# DB_File - A Perl Interface to Berkeley DB 1.x


`DB_File` is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the
API provided by version 1 of the Berkeley DB library.

This module can also be used with version 2, or greater, of the Berkeley DB library as long as Berkeley DB was built with the 1.85 API compatibility code. This is done by including the `--enable-compat185` option when the Berkeley DB library is built.

For installation instructions see [README](../README).

API Documentation is in [DB_File.pod](DB_File.pod).

The CPAN location for this module is [here](https://metacpan.org/pod/DB_File)
